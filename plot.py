"""
Implementation of eval_plot3d that use numpy to efficiently evaluate Plot3D
(that is, compute a Graphics3D) by using numpy.

Uses compile.demo_compile to compile the function to be plotted into
a Python function that will take numpy arrays for efficient computation of the function.

Generates Graphics3D that contains GraphicsComplex, which is an efficient
representation of graphics objects like meshes. As far as I know this, while standard
Mathematica, is not yet understood by any part of Mathics, although it is understood
by the demo layout functions in graphics.py.
